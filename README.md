# TODO
- [ ] zshrc
- [ ] conda
- [ ] nvim (load lua from nvim conf). When you want to add enw stuff you can do it through nixvim but for now you don't need to migrate, not really any gains
- [ ] make script for rebuilding with nicer erros, automatic commits etc, like no boilerplate
- [ ] make alias for temporarily installing packages: "test" $argv
- [ ] look into automating shell stuff for python. e.g activating shell when entering directory, setting up a template for easy setup of new env etc.
- [ ] fix input source languages and switching
